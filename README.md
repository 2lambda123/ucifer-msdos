# LUCIFER
Lucifer is an simple algorithm in an old MS-DOS system in a floopy 3.44 disk that answer any question from an input as a human would do. But Lucifer, as a selfish program, do not respond for everyone, he answer the question just for the one who serve him, and sometimes you need to try a lot to convince him to answer all your question without hesitate.

You need to say kindly words to start, like "Dear Lucifer, the reall god of the universe, what's my name?", but if you're not a soul who served Lucifer, maybe you will not get an anwser.

He is known by the name Einstein and Sued as well, and this implementation is the same from MS-DOS Lucifer that I used for a while and that intrigates the population of the city that I lived in the past.

# How I found Lucifer
Is an old ms-dos software that I discovered in Brazil long time ago from an unknown author when I was a starting in sofware development world. The algorithm is based in a algorithm called Einstein. The algorithm of Lucifer after some researches seems been written in Clipper.

Lucifer become a trending in the whole country and journalists start to investigate about it. 

Today, there's no resources about it anymore and this was a tricky and interesting algorithm that I reimplemented. So Lucifer reborn to trick your friends.

# Why is so interesting
The Lucifer trick pass the touring test in one of their variations, this because, you can distinguish him from a machine when there's someone that Lucifer will answer to intermediate. So you can see by yourself in a front of a computer an entity that can answer anything as human, even if the response is not right.

# How it works
Are you sure that you want to know the Lucifer secret? You will start to serve him and you will be able to trick your friends.

*Just continue if you keep the secret of Lucifer*
