# LUCIFER
It's an simple algorithm in an old MS-DOS system in a floopy 3.44 disk that answer any question from an input as a human would do. But Lucifer, as a selfish program, do not respond for everyone, he answer the question just for the one who serve him, and sometimes you need to try a lot to convince him to answer all your question without hesitate.

You need to say kindly words to start, like "Dear Lucifer, the reall god of the universe, what's my name?", but if you're not a soul who served Lucifer, maybe you will not get an anwser.

# How I found Lucifer
Is an old ms-dos software that I discovered in Brazil long time ago from an unknown author when I was a starting in sofware development world.

Today, there's no resources about it anymore and this was a tricky and interesting algorithm that I reimplemented. So Lucifer reborn to trick your friends

# How it works
